Implement a Deterministic Automatic Stack (NAS) that recognizes expressions consisting of the characters ‘x’ and ‘y’, in such a way that:
- the more ‘x’ characters appear in total, the more ‘y’ characters appear
in total
- looking at the expression from left to right, the characters ‘y’ are never more than the ‘x’ characters.
Print the sequence of steps that led to the recognition (or rejection) of expression.
