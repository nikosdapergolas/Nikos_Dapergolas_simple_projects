Grammar is given
S → (X)
Χ → ΥΖ
Υ → α | β | S
Ζ → * Χ | -Χ | + Χ | e
Check if the grammar is LL (1). If it is LL (1), then construct a syntax
top-down parser that recognizes the string or responds negatively as
to its syntactic correctness. Return the relevant tree and print it.
Make a demonstration for the expression ((β-α) * (α + β)).
